= FX Installer Theme

This project includes a sample installer theme written in JavaFX.  This is intentionally bare-bones and not practical to make it easy to understand, and so that it can be used as a template for custom themes.

See link:../README.adoc[Custom themes documentation] for details on how to use this as the basis for your own theme.
