= jDeploy JavaFX Archetype

An archetype for generating JavaFX projects that are bootstrapped with workflows to generate native app installers on every commit, and every release using GitHub actions.

== Features

Native Desktop App Installers::
This project includes a GitHub actions workflow that generates native installers for each branch and release.  https://github.com/shannah/jdeploy-javafx-starter/releases/tag/master[See example].

JavaFX 19::
Based on the official https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#maven[javafx-archetype-simple archetype] developed by the openjfx project.

Java 17::
Currently builds for Java 17, but will be updated to support latest LTS release.

TIP: This archetype was used to generate the https://github.com/shannah/jdeploy-javafx-starter[jdeploy-javafx-starter] Github repository template, which provides, perhaps, a simpler way to bootstrap a JavaFX project.  Just click "Use this template", and you're all set.
