# jDeploy

Developer friendly desktop deployment tool.  See [the jDeploy Website](https://www.jdeploy.com) for usage instructions.

## GitHub Action Instructions

The jdeploy github action allows you to generate native desktop installers for your Java project in a Github workflow.  This action can be run for both commits and releases.  

If used on a commit to a branch, it will publish the the app installers to a release named after the branch. E.g. For the "master" branch, it would post installers to a tag named "master".  If used on a "tag", it will simply add the installers as artifacts of the release.  In both cases it will add some download links to the release notes.

### Example Workflow:

```yaml
# This workflow will build a Java project with Maven and bundle them as native app installers with jDeploy
